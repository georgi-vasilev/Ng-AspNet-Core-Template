# Ng-AspNet-Core-Template

The template is based on Nikolay Kostov's template, however, it was modified to be Single-page application (SPA) with Angular 12.
The BaseService, BaseDeletableService and some of the mapping extensions are created and kindly provided by my dear friend Atanas Vasilev.
There is also JWT Authentication implemented as well as some extension methods for the user.
I've used some extension methods in infrastructure project that I've seen from Ivaylo Kenov's Catstagram app.

This template gives you implementation for JWT Authentication in the front-end and in the back-end and it is ready to use.
The front-end uses ng-bootstrap and toasts that are already added. There is only user module and login/register components.
Also there is provided BaseService in the front-end as well.
Please if you have any other ideas for features you'd like to add feel free to make a PR and whenever I have free time I will go through them.
If you liked it leave a star.
